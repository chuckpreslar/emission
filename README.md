)

func main() {
  emitter := emission.NewEmitter()

  hello := func(to string) {
    fmt.Printf("Hello %s!\n", to)
  }
  
  count := func(count int) {
    for i := 0; i < count; i++ {
      fmt.Println(i)
    }
  }
  
  emitter.On("hello", hello)
  emitter.On("count", count)
  emitter.Emit("hello", "world")
  emitter.Emit("count", 5)
}

```
